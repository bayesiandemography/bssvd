Description: Build objects holding data on
  age profiles for demographic processes such as
  fertility, mortality, and labour force participation.
  The objects are constructed by performing singular
  value decompositions on data from international demographic
  databasaes. Package 'bssvd' is designed to support
  package 'bage'. It is developer-focused, and would
  not normally be used directly for data analysis.
